-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes for the player are on the left.
Cards are the cards the player has on the bottom left.
Notifications that come from the game as a result of an action are on the top.
Game status (who is connected, whose turn it is) is on the bottom.
Buttons for the different actions (move, suggest, accuse) are on the bottom right.
Chat interface is on the right.

when an action is selected, then a pop up appears to get a selection.
click move button, then get a pop up to choose a location to move to.


For real-time updates, the websocket should connect at 
/game/<gameid>/messages


All actions lead to POSTs (possibly chat as well)

For example, move goes to 

/game/<gameid>/move

The game updates its internal state, and it sends a message to each connected client with notifications, gamestate, status, chat, etc. The message comes over the websocket.
